- getchar(): reads one line from std in and eats the char.
    ex. int c = getchar()

- scanf: reads for desired type from std in.
    ex. int x; int retCode = scanf("%d", x);
    - returns exit status (0 if it does not find desired type, 1 if success)
    - does not eat char if it fails
    - ignores whitespace
