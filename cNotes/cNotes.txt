- getchar(): reads one line from std in and eats the char.
    ex. int c = getchar()   

- scanf: reads for desired type from std in.
    ex. int x; int retCode = scanf("%d", x);
    - returns exit status (0 if it does not find desired type, 1 if success)
    - does not eat char if it fails
    - ignores whitespace


### Const
const int x = 10; 
x = 5; // illegal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = 15;

const int *px = &x; // cannot change x through px
*px = 10; // illegal
px = &z; // legal
x = 10 // still legal because only the dereferenced pointer is const
// functions take pointers to values to mutate them instead of the actual variable
// passing an array into a function also passes the pointer to the first index
// making this const stops the function from changing these dereferenced pointers (functions like findMax)

int * const py = &y; // cannot change the pointer itself
*py = 15; // legal
py = &x // illegal

int const *pz = &z; // same as what happens to x
